## Graph-based Unsupervised Metric Learning (GUML)
```
Github repository for our paper: Graph-based Unsupervised Metric Learning
```

The Repository contains:
```
1. GUML_demo.ipynb : Demostrates how do learn a metric using 
   Riemannian optimization with Pymanopt+Autograd
   
2. GUML_demo_PyTorch.ipynb : Demostrates how do learn a metric using
   Riemannian optimization with Pymanopt+PyTorch
   
3. Triplet_net_sGUML_demo.ipynb: Demostrates how do learn a deep metric using 
   Riemannian optimization with Pymanopt+PyTorch, in an end-to-end manner using 
   stochastic optimization. 
   The backbone neural network has a Triplet Network architecture.
